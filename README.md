Clone an ES6 Class as Another Class Name for Isolating Class Static Properties. 

## EXAMPLE

### Shell

```shell
$ npm i clone-class
```

### TypeScript

```ts
import cloneClass from 'clone-class'

class Employee {
  public static company: string

  constructor(
    public name: string,
  ) {
  }

  public info() {
    console.log(`Employee ${this.name}, Company ${(this.constructor as any).company}`)
  }
}

const GoogleEmployee = cloneClass(Employee)
GoogleEmployee.company = 'Google'

const MicrosoftEmployee = cloneClass(Employee)
MicrosoftEmployee.company = 'Microsoft'

const employee1 = new GoogleEmployee('Tom')
const employee2 = new MicrosoftEmployee('Jerry')

employee1.info()
// Output: Employee Tom, Company Google
employee2.info()
// Output: Employee Jerry, Company Microsoft
```

The most tricky part of this code is `(this.constructor as any).company`.

It will be very clear after we break down it as the following steps:

1. `this.constructor` is the constructor function of the class, which shuold be the _class function_ itself.
1. `company` is a static properity defined in `Employee` class, which will be set as a property on the _class function_.
1. So `this.constructor.company` is equal to `Employee.company`, except that we will not need to know the exact name of the class, `Employee` in this case. We use this pattern is because we need to visit the _class function_ even we do not know it's name.
